TASK 1
The solutions with BC impose can be found at task1.ipynb


TASK 2
This part can be found in second.ipynb notebook.
The Dynamical equations are that was solved are given in the notebook itself.

[step-1] For different alpha values the, Graphs of Evolution of Br and Bphi with respect to time and space are shown separately.

For different values of alpha, step-1 is repeated.

The finding of critical dynamo number hasn't been fully automated.

After looking at the graphs of Log(B) Vs Time fo different alpha values, a suitable alpha range was selected.

Then within the same, the tail behaviour was studied-namely the slope.

Whenever the slope changed signs, the average value of corresponding alpha was taken for evaluaion of critical dynamo number.

THe critical dynamo number is a function of r, however for plotting purposes the Log(B) value was averaged over all r.

Hence the critical number was left as a function of r.
